# Gherkin-Based User Stories

This document outlines our approach to managing user stories with Gherkin syntax for the Skill Management System project.

## Gherkin Format

We use Gherkin syntax for our user stories, which directly translates to automated tests:

```gherkin
Feature: [Feature Name]

  Background:
    Given [common setup for all scenarios]
    
  Scenario: [Descriptive title of the scenario]
    Given [precondition]
    When [action]
    Then [expected result]
```

## Organization

Our user stories are organized in feature files by screen/component:

```
docs/
└── user_stories/
    ├── README.md                   # This documentation file
    └── features/
        ├── overview/               # Features for the overview screen
        │   ├── view_people_list.feature
        │   └── filter_people.feature
        ├── detail/                 # Features for the detail screen
        │   ├── view_profile.feature
        │   └── manage_skills.feature
        └── skill/                  # Features for the skill screen
            ├── view_skill_details.feature
            └── find_skilled_people.feature
```

## Benefits of this Approach

1. **Testable:** Features translate directly to automated tests
2. **Clear:** Scenarios define exact behavior in a standardized format
3. **Accessible:** Non-technical stakeholders can understand and validate
4. **Precise:** Leaves little room for ambiguity in implementation
5. **Living Documentation:** Tests based on these stories serve as executable documentation

## Implementation Guide

- Each feature file should focus on a specific capability
- Use Background for common setup steps
- Write scenarios from the user's perspective
- Use Scenario Outlines for parameterized tests
- Include acceptance criteria as scenarios
