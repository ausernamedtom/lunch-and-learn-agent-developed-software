# ADR-001: Using React with TypeScript for Frontend Development

## Status
Accepted (2025-05-27)

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework for our Skill Management System. The application will involve complex UI components, state management, and API integrations. We need something that is maintainable, scalable, and has good developer tooling.

## Decision
We will use React with TypeScript for frontend development, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Strong type safety with TypeScript reduces runtime errors
  - React's component model enables reusable UI elements
  - Large ecosystem with many libraries available
  - Tailwind provides utility-first approach for rapid UI development
  - Good developer experience with hot reloading and debugging tools
  
- **Negative**:
  - Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with React or TypeScript
  - Build configuration can become complex
  - TypeScript adds compilation time
  
## Alternatives Considered
- **Vue.js**: Good option but fewer team members are familiar with it
- **Angular**: More opinionated and has steeper learning curve
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Not scalable enough for our complex UI needs
