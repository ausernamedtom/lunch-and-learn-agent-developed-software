# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

## What are ADRs?

Architectural Decision Records (ADRs) are documents that capture important architectural decisions made along with their context and consequences. They provide a record of key decisions that affect the structure, non-functional characteristics, dependencies, interfaces, or construction techniques of a system.

## ADR Structure

Each ADR should follow this structure:

### Title
A short phrase describing the decision, usually in the format "ADR-NNN: Decision Title"

### Status
One of: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded

### Context
The problem being addressed and relevant factors that influence the decision

### Decision
The decision that was made, clearly and concisely stated

### Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult as a result of this decision

### Alternatives Considered
Other options that were considered and why they were not chosen

## Example ADR

```markdown
# ADR-001: Using React with TypeScript for Frontend Development

## Status
Accepted (2025-05-27)

## Context
We need to choose a frontend framework for our Skill Management System. The application will involve complex UI components, state management, and API integrations. We need something that is maintainable, scalable, and has good developer tooling.

## Decision
We will use React with TypeScript for frontend development, along with Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Strong type safety with TypeScript reduces runtime errors
  - React's component model enables reusable UI elements
  - Large ecosystem with many libraries available
  - Tailwind provides utility-first approach for rapid UI development
  - Good developer experience with hot reloading and debugging tools
  
- **Negative**:
  - Learning curve for team members unfamiliar with React or TypeScript
  - Build configuration can become complex
  - TypeScript adds compilation time
  
## Alternatives Considered
- **Vue.js**: Good option but fewer team members are familiar with it
- **Angular**: More opinionated and has steeper learning curve
- **Vanilla JavaScript**: Not scalable enough for our complex UI needs
```

## Storing ADRs

ADRs should be:
- Stored in version control alongside the code
- Numbered sequentially
- Easily accessible to all team members
- Referenced in relevant code or documentation

## ADRs in this Project

All ADRs for the Skill Management System will be stored in:

```
docs/decisions/
```
