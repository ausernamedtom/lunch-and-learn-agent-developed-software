# ADR-004: C# API with Entity Framework for Backend Development

## Status
Accepted (2025-05-27)

## Context
We need to select a backend technology stack for our Skill Management System. The backend needs to handle data operations, business logic, API endpoints, and integration with our chosen database. We need a solution that is robust, offers good ORM capabilities, and supports modern API patterns.

## Decision
We will use C# with ASP.NET Core for our API development, leveraging Entity Framework Core with a Code First approach for our ORM, and implementing HATEOAS principles for improved API discoverability.

## Consequences
- **Positive**:
  - Strong typing and compile-time checking improves code quality
  - Entity Framework Core with Code First approach allows model-driven database development
  - Database migrations can be generated from C# model changes, simplifying schema evolution
  - ASP.NET Core provides excellent performance and cross-platform capabilities
  - HATEOAS implementation enhances API usability and discoverability
  - Extensive ecosystem and tooling support from Microsoft
  - Good integration with Azure services
  
- **Negative**:
  - Higher learning curve compared to some other frameworks
  - More verbose than some dynamic language alternatives
  - HATEOAS implementation adds additional development overhead
  - Requires Windows development environment for optimal experience
  
## Alternatives Considered
- **Node.js with Express**: Lighter weight but less structured for large applications
- **Java with Spring Boot**: Good enterprise option but more complex than needed
- **Python with Django/Flask**: Great for rapid development but less performance optimized
- **PHP with Laravel**: Lower barrier to entry but less suitable for complex applications

## EF Core Code First Approach
We will follow these principles for our EF Core Code First implementation:

- Define domain models as C# classes with appropriate properties and relationships
- Use data annotations and fluent API for configuration
- Implement a DbContext that configures all entity relationships
- Use migrations for controlled schema evolution
- Follow repository pattern to abstract data access
- Use dependency injection for DbContext management
- Implement proper transaction handling for multi-entity operations
