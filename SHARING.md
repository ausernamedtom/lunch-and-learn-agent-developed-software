# Sharing the Repository with Other Developers

## Option 1: Using GitHub (or similar Git hosting service)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Fill in the repository name (e.g., "skill-management-system")
   - Add an optional description
   - Choose public or private visibility
   - Click "Create repository"

2. Connect your local repository to the remote GitHub repository
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/yourusername/skill-management-system.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

3. Share the GitHub repository URL with your team members

## Option 2: Using Git Bundle (for direct sharing without a hosting service)

If you want to share the repository directly without using GitHub or similar services:

1. Create a bundle file containing all commits
   ```bash
   git bundle create skill-management-system.bundle --all
   ```

2. Share this bundle file with other developers (via email, file sharing, etc.)

3. Other developers can then clone from this bundle
   ```bash
   git clone skill-management-system.bundle -b main skill-management-system
   cd skill-management-system
   ```

## Option 3: Using a Shared Network Drive or File Server

1. Create a bare repository on the shared drive
   ```bash
   git clone --bare . /path/to/shared/drive/skill-management-system.git
   ```

2. Other developers can then clone from this location
   ```bash
   git clone /path/to/shared/drive/skill-management-system.git
   ```

## Collaborating with the Team

Once developers have the repository, they can contribute by:

1. Pulling the latest changes
   ```bash
   git pull
   ```

2. Creating a branch for their changes
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/my-feature
   ```

3. Making and committing changes
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add detailed description for feature X"
   ```

4. Pushing their changes
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/my-feature
   ```

5. Creating a pull request (if using GitHub) or requesting a merge
